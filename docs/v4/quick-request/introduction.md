## Introduction

**QuickRequest** is a lightweight tool designed for swift and uncomplicated requests to the Laravel backend. Leveraging the "fetch" mechanism, this solution facilitates executing requests to Laravel controllers without the need for manual assignment of tokens, base URLs, hidden fields, and other parameters specific to the chosen method.

Tailored to specific requirements, QuickRequest provides essential features to effortlessly manage various request types in a standard Laravel application, including GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. Moreover, it offers a convenient approach to efficiently download files by effectively handling Blobs.

QuickRequest should be installed independently. Although developed as a complement to PHP2JS, it can be used as a standalone tool.
